# Sexditor

this was just a little project to learn how to work with ratatui, the system is garbage and this should never be used by anyone but it's kinda fun to edit the syntax highlighting with regex.

to run just do `cargo run -r -- ./path/to/file` from the root directory of the project

## Available commands

since there's no suggestions on the command line it's kinda hard to know

`theme <themename>` to set the theme, no `.toml` or anything just the name and no path
`w` take a wild fuggin guess
`x` take a wild fuggin guess
`q` take a wild fuggin guess
